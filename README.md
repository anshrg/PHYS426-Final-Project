Final Computational Project - Fermi Gas in a Box
Final project for PHYS 426 - Thermal Physics (University of Arizona)

## Project Description:
See the accompanying report, **Final Project Report.pdf**, for a full description of the theory, procedure, results, and discussion.

Consider a system of fermions in a 3 dimensional, cubical box with side length $L$. Analytically, the expected relationship between the side length of the box and the average energy of the system can be found in terms of the volume of the box (V), its surface area (A), a small fluctuating term ($\delta{E}$). 

$$ E = \rho_E{V} + \sigma_E{A} + \delta{E} $$

Here, I reproduce this relationship by calculating the averge total energy of a fermi gas for a variety of box side lengths. The analysis is carried out for mutliple regimes of temperatures and chemical potentials. By fitting the analytical form of the relationship to the computed values, the derived energy density of the Fermi gas $\rho_E$, surface energy $\sigma_E$, and fluctuation term $\delta{E}$ are found.
